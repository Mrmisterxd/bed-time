This program is needed to make it easier to set the bedtime, instead of using the inconvenient command in Win+R. The program makes this process more convenient.
# Description of choosing:
`1. Set bedtime in seconds` - Sets a sleep timer for Windows in seconds.

*The meaning of this command in Win+R is "shutdown -a"*

`3. Set bedtime in hours` - Sets a sleep timer for Windows in hours.
*It executes the command in Win+R; your value in "shutdown -s -t" will be seconds multiply 3600.*

`4. Set bedtime in minutes` - Sets a sleep timer for Windows in hours.

# `5. Russian roulette` - 
Russian Roulette: you are given two numbers to choose from, the chance of choosing the first number is 50 percent, the second number is also 50 percent, and with a 50/50 chance your computer may **INSTANTLY SHUT DOWN.** ***The author is not responsible for this.*** With a 50/50 chance, the command "shutdown -s -t" will be executed, which is equivalent to an immediate computer shutdown. 

### ***Before using option 5, make sure you have saved important data and will not suffer any damage/risk if your computer shuts down instantly without confirmation.*** (This is the dealer's bet!)

`6. Check bedtime` -
